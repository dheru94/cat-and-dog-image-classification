# Cat vs Dog Classifier Web App

This is a web application that uses a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The model is built using TensorFlow and saved in the project folder. The app allows users to upload images or drag and drop images of cats or dogs for prediction.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of a dog or a cat.
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag and drop images for prediction.
- **Prediction**: The model classifies the image as either a dog or a cat.
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
- **Back-end**: Flask for serving the model and handling image predictions.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- Other Python dependencies listed below

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-vs-dog-classifier.git
cd cat-vs-dog-classifier
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate   # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash

4. Running the Application
Ensure that your trained model is saved in the project folder (e.g., as model), then run the Flask application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The app will be hosted locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

5. Test the Web App
Open the app in your browser.

Upload or drag and drop an image to get predictions for whether the image is of a dog or a cat.
